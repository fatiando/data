# LiDAR point cloud of the Trail Islands in British Columbia, Canada

This is a LiDAR point cloud from the 
[LidarBC](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services/lidarbc) 
project, sliced to the small 
[Trail Islands](https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/21973.html) North of Vancouver 
to reduce the data size. The islands have some nice looking topography and their 
isolated nature creates problems for some interpolation methods.

Processing and standardization were performed in
[prepare.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/fatiando/rockhound-data/blob/main/lidar-british-columbia/prepare.ipynb).
