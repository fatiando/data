# Ground gravity of Southern Africa

This is a public domain compilation of ground measurements of gravity from 
Southern Africa distributed by the [NOAA NCEI](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/).

The horizontal datum is not specified and heights are referenced to "sea level", 
which we will interpret as the geoid (which realization is likely not relevant 
since the uncertainty in the height is probably larger than geoid model differences).
Heights were not converted to geometric since that can be done in tutorials for 
better educational purposes.

Processing and standardization were performed in
[prepare.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/fatiando/rockhound-data/blob/main/southern-africa-gravity/prepare.ipynb).
