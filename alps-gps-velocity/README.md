# GPS velocities for the Alpine region

This is a compilation of 3D GPS velocities for the Alps by
[Sánchez et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.886889).
The horizontal velocities are reference to the Eurasian frame. 
All velocity components and even the position have error estimates,
which is very useful and rare to find in a lot of datasets.

Processing and standardization were performed in
[prepare.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/fatiando/rockhound-data/blob/main/alps-gps-velocity/prepare.ipynb).
